### Welcome to FieldWorkAssistant.
The site will use basic web forms to collect project information, interactive forms for field personnel to collect data, and mapping tools to identify and organize the work locations.

There will be three levels of users:
- PM or Project managers who can:
  *> use all functionalities of the tool within their assigned projects.
- Field worker:
  *> view map to find locations
  *> fill forms
  *> mark a location by giving a label and button click
- Software developer:
  *> Test Stage site to validate software updates or debug on real data (read only rights)
